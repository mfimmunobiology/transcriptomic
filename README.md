# Transcriptomics and R Programming Course

This repository hosts materials for a course centered on transcriptomics, specifically designed to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction to 
transcriptome sequencing alongside R programming skills. While the primary focus of our lab is on applying transcriptomic analysis to unravel the 
complexities of maternal-fetal immunobiology, the methodologies and insights provided here are versatile and applicable across various domains of 
scientific research. Key components of the course include:

    **Transcriptome Sequencing:** Fundamental concepts and methodologies.
    R Programming: Practical skills in R tailored to transcriptomic data analysis.
    Data Analysis Training: Hands-on exercises in analyzing microarray data, RNA-Seq, and single-cell analysis.
    Dataset Utilization: Utilizing publicly available pre-processed datasets, primarily from GEO/SRA databases.

In this course, we leverage a combination of modern educational tools to enhance learning:

    GitHub: This platform serves as the primary repository for all course materials, including code, datasets, and documentation.
    Markdowns: We utilize Markdown files for clear and structured documentation, ensuring that instructions and explanations are easy to follow.
    YouTube Videos: Comprehensive instructional videos are available on YouTube, providing visual and auditory learning to complement the written materials.

This course is designed for individuals seeking to develop a comprehensive understanding of transcriptomic analysis, supported by interactive and accessible educational resources.
